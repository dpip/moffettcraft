        <span>WORK </span>&nbsp;
         When an artist sincerely offers energy, heart and time into a piece,
        a small part of the artist is also given.

        I obtained my master's in special education from NC State University,
        taught exceptional populations for 11 years in public schools,
        recieved my BFA in art from UNC-Greensboro then continued teaching art for a decade in the
        elementary school setting utilizing the arts to create strategies for learning,
        achievement and personal expression with a variety of populations.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span>JOY </span>&nbsp;
        I now am a working artist very much involved with youth camps, community workshops and am
        pursuing certifications in art therapy. My journey in the arts is one I love sharing with others.

        <span>Expression </span>&nbsp;
        Social media sprouted around the new museum in critique of our time as post-analog, which is not
        true for artists to forgo the sensory immersion of imax or the transfiguration often precedes like!
        Our experience of everyday life. Also playing with sonic possibilities through the analog and digital
        world.
